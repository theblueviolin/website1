            <h1>Gotta Catch 'em All!</h1>
            <p>Your goal in this game is to earn as many Pokeballs as possible while catching a variety of Pokemon along the way. 

            <br><br> To play simply click on one of the three grass clumps in the forest. Behind one of those grass clumps is a Pokemon that can be caught. Behind another grass clump are two free Pokeballs that you can use to try again, and behind the last grass clump is nothing. 
            <br><br> It won't happen every round, but sometimes you can encounter a "super" Pokemon. Additionally, you can click a button that appears after each round to display the result history of the current game. 
            <br><br>If you choose to start over, click play again to begin a new game. The result history and pokemon caught will be cleared, and you will restarted with 5 Pokeballs.</p>
